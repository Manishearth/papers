% This is the unified bibliography for Manticore papers and proposals.  To keep things
% sane, we use the following conventions:
%
%  1) keys should be based on the title of the paper
%  2) entries are sorted by the lead author's last name
%  3) use strings for conference/journal titles, publishers, publisher addresses,
%     conference locations, etc.  Each string should be defined in strings-long.bib
%     and strings-short.bib.
